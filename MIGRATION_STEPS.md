# Migration Steps: Transitioning to the New Architecture

This document outlines the specific steps to complete the migration from the old provider architecture to the new consolidated architecture.

## Current Status

We've created new files with the new architecture alongside the existing files:

- New base provider: `base_provider.py` (replacing `base.py`)
- New request handler: `request_handler.py` (new)
- New provider factory: `provider_factory.py` (new)
- New provider registry: `provider_registry.py` (new)
- New provider implementations: `openai_provider.py`, `anthropic_provider.py` (replacing `openai.py`, `anthropic.py`)
- New chunking module: `chunking.py` (new)
- New summarizer: `summarizer_new.py` (replacing `summarizer.py`)
- New CLI: `main_new.py` (replacing `main.py`)

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Complete Provider Implementations

1. Implement the remaining providers as outlined in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:
   - Google (Gemini) Provider
   - Groq Provider
   - Cerebras Provider
   - DeepSeek Provider
   - Ollama Provider

### Step 2: Testing

1. Create tests for the new architecture
2. Ensure all tests pass with both the old and new implementations
3. Verify that the new implementation works correctly with all providers

### Step 3: Replace Old Files

Once testing is complete, replace the old files with the new ones:

1. Rename `base_provider.py` to `base.py` (replacing the old file)
2. Rename `openai_provider.py` to `openai.py` (replacing the old file)
3. Rename `anthropic_provider.py` to `anthropic.py` (replacing the old file)
4. Create the new provider files with their final names (without the `_provider` suffix)
5. Rename `summarizer_new.py` to `summarizer.py` (replacing the old file)
6. Rename `main_new.py` to `main.py` (replacing the old file)
7. Update `__init__.py` to use the new imports

### Step 4: Update Package Structure

1. Update the `__init__.py` files to expose the new API
2. Ensure backward compatibility where possible
3. Update any import statements in other parts of the codebase

### Step 5: Documentation

1. Update the main README.md with information from README_UPDATE.md
2. Finalize the MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for users
3. Remove temporary files like README_UPDATE.md and MIGRATION_STEPS.md

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain backward compatibility during the transition:

1. The new `BaseProvider` class should support the same interface as the old one
2. The new `Summarizer` class should accept the same parameters as the old one
3. The CLI should support both old and new options

## Timeline

1. Complete provider implementations (1-2 days)
2. Testing and validation (1-2 days)
3. File replacement and package structure updates (1 day)
4. Documentation updates (1 day)
5. Final review and release (1 day)

## After Migration

Once the migration is complete:

1. Remove any temporary files and documentation
2. Update version number to reflect the major architectural change
3. Create a release with detailed release notes
4. Notify users of the new architecture and migration guide
